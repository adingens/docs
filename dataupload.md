<a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> takes three input files.
1. [data file for the site plot and mutation plot](#data-file)
2. [protein structure file ](#protein-structure)
3. [description file](#description-file)

Below are instructions on [how to construct the input files](#input-files), [how to host the input files](#hosting-input-files), and [how to load the input files to the site](#how-to-load-your-data).

# Input files

## Data file

The data file is the main source of data for <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a>.

This file contains the measurements for the site plot, the measurements for the mutation plot, and the map between the site plot numbering and the protein structure numbering.

The data file is a `csv` (comma-separated file) and it must have the following columns:
* **site**: The site plot will be ordered by this column. The values must be ordinal.
* **label_site**: The site plot will be labeled by this column. The values can be numeric or a string.
* **wildtype**: The wildtype at a given site. The tooltips will display this information. The values can be numeric or a string.
* **mutation**: The mutation plot will display this mutation. The values must be a single uppercase letter.
* **condition**: The experimental condition used in the experiment to generate the data for the site plot and the mutation plot. The dropdown menu will display the conditions and the user can toggle between different conditions.
* **protein_chain**: The protein chain(s) in the pdb file for a given site. The values must be in a space-separated list. For example, populating the cell with `A C` will highlight the site on chains A and C (but not B).
* **protein_site**: The protein site in the pdb file for a given site.

The data file must contain at least one column from each of the following categories.

* **site_***: The value for a given site for a given metric (represented by `*`). The values must be numeric. For example, `site_mean`.
* **mut_***: The value for a given site for a given mutation for a given metric (represented by `*`). The values must be numeric. For example, `mut_mean`.

The metric names represented by _*_ above will populate the site metric and mutation metric dropdown menus.

## example: HIV antibody escape

Imagine an experiment to test the effect of alanine mutations on the ability of antibodies to bind to HIV.
In this small experiment, the effect of an alanine mutation was measured at position 1 or position 2 for antibody A and antibody B.

Here is what the data file might look like for this experiment.

site|site_label|wildtype|mutation|condition|protein_chain|protein_site|mut_max|mut_mean|site_median|
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
1|pos1|G|A|Ab1|A|27|5|3.5|7
1|pos1|G|A|Ab2|A|27|0|0|7
2|pos2|D|A|Ab1|A|27|0|0|45
2|pos2|D|A|Ab2|A|27|100|50|45

Note how the the **site_*** values are repeated for each mutation at that site.
For a real world example, see [the default data file used by `dms_view`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dms-view/dms-view.github.io/master/data/IAV/flu_dms-view.csv).

## protein structure

The protein structure file is a [pdb file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)).

The data file columns **site**, **protein_chain**, and **protein_site** map differences in numbering between the site/mutation plot and the protein structure.
Specifically, the **protein_site** column contains the correspondence between the site/mutation values and the protein structure.

If the protein structure has multiple homologous chains, you can specify which chains the site will be plotted on using the a *space*-separated list in the **protein_chain** column.
See the [data file description](#data-file) section for more details.

You can see the protein file used in the default <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> view [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dms-view/dms-view.github.io/master/4O5N_trimer.pdb).

## description file

The description file is a [markdown file](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
You can use the description file to explain your experiment, acknowledge contributors, or make analysis notes.

You can see the protein file used in the default <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> view [HERE](https://github.com/dms-view/dms-view.github.io/blob/master/lee2019mapping.md).

# Hosting input files

Before you can load any of the three files to <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a>, you must host the files somewhere else with a link to the raw data.  
This can be as easy as uploading them to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and linking to the **Raw** files.
Github shows an HTML version by default so you will need to click on the **View raw** link  
![view raw](/images/view_raw.png)  
and the URL should start with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/`.  

![raw url](/images/raw_url.png)  


You can still use <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> even if you data is a private repo or directory.
The only caveat is that the <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> URL sharing will not work.

# How to load your data

Once you have your input files hosted, you can load the data into <a href="https://dms-view.github.io" target="_blank">`dms_view`</a> by filling in the form fields on the front page.
The [data file](#data-file) form field is above the site plot, the [protein file](#protein-structure) form field is above the protein structure and the [description file](#description-file) form field is above the description section at the bottom of the site.
The [data file](#data-file) link must be to the **raw** data on Github not the HTML rendering.
See [Hosting input files](#hosting-input-files) for more information.

All of the data files are saved in the URL.
Once the data is loaded, you can share this new URL with others and _your_ data will load for them.
